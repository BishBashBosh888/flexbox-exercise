                        <p>Ousama Ranking (Ranking of Kings) is an anime series that follows the journey of Bojji, a mute, small, and seemingly weak young prince who is born into a royal family. Despite being ridiculed by his peers and underestimated by those around him, Bojji harbors an unwavering determination to prove his worth and claim his rightful place as king. As the firstborn son of King Bosse, one of the most powerful rulers in the world, Bojji faces immense pressure to live up to his father’s legacy.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The story unfolds as Bojji forms an unlikely bond with a shadowy, rogue figure named Kage, who becomes his companion and helps him navigate the challenges that come with being an underdog in a world dominated by power and strength. As Bojji embarks on his journey to rise beyond his perceived limitations, he encounters both allies and adversaries, and uncovers secrets about his family and kingdom that challenge everything he thought he knew.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In this heartfelt and visually stunning tale, Ousama Ranking explores themes of personal growth, perseverance, and the true nature of strength, showing that greatness is not determined by outward appearances but by one’s inner resolve.</p>
